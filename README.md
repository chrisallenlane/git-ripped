About
-----
- ASCII art?
- Python compatibility layer between your soft, shitty programmer body, and the
  unused exercise equipment in your immediate vicinity.

Advantages
----------
- Exercise occurs after commits, which is a natural best point
- Encourages you to step away from your computer periodically

Installing
----------
- Just copy the two files

Configuration
-------------
- Config file
- params:

`adaptive`
`color`
`logfile`
`max_rest_time`
`random`
`exercises`

Usage
-----
- Configure as git post-commit hook
- CSV output

_Successful_ Usage
------------------
Make sure to tune it properly that you don't just start ignoring it. If you're
too ambitious in the configs, you'll just ignore the robot, rendering it
pointless.
